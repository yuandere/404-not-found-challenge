<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](https://github.com/yuandere/404-not-found-challenge/blob/alt/404screenshot.jpg?raw=true)

This is a simple responsive 404 error page concept I put together using mobile-first principles and flexbox. I actually learned more about the process of version control through Github Desktop than I did about HTML/CSS on this project but I need to start somewhere right? :)
